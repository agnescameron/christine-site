Hi, I'm Christine! I'm running to be the next CUSU/GU Welfare + Rights officer because I'm committed to helping improve the standards of student support and care at this university. I believe good welfare provision involves listening to students, representing their needs, and making welfare as accessible and inclusive as possible. 
<br><br>
I'm a third year History of Art student at Newnham who is interested in liberation politics, art, psychology, accessibility and thinking about the possibilities and limitations of self-care.
